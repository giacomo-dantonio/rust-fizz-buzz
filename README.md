# FizzBuzz

This is a sample rust boilerplate project,
similar to [this C++ repository](https://github.com/giacomo-dantonio/cmake-boilerplate).

For rust `cargo` will do most of the work for you, so you don't really
need a boilerplate project.
This projects contains the following stuff in addition to a clean
`cargo new` project:

* A library that implements [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz), for demonstration purposes.
* Unit tests for that library.
* Error handling with [anyhow](https://docs.rs/anyhow/latest/anyhow/).
* Command line argument parsing with [clap](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/).
